      <p className="about__text">
        BayaniHub is a community-driven platform designed to strengthen barangay
        civic engagement across the Philippines. Our mission is to bridge the gap
        between local government and residents by providing accessible digital
        tools for communication, collaboration, and community building.
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        We believe that every Filipino deserves a voice in their community.
        Through BayaniHub, residents can stay informed about barangay
        announcements, participate in local decision-making, report issues that
        need attention, and connect with their neighbors for a stronger, more
        united community.
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        The word &ldquo;Bayani&rdquo; means hero in Filipino — because every
        community member who takes part in civic engagement is a hero in their
        own right.
